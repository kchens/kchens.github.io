#Hello 


1. While we are all born with a set number of neurons, new science says that the hippocampus -- important for learning and memory --  new neurons are being born. 

Having a rich environment seems to double the strengths of the connections of the neurons in *rats*. But in absence of a rich environment, exercise can do the same -- 2x neuron return. 


2. The focused mode is centered in the prefrontal cortex -- where working memory is -- and is activated when you're "focused" and working on things you're (somewhat) familiar with. 

But, if you're learning something new, the "diffused" mode of thinking may be more helpful. The "diffused" mode is also noted as the "default mode network" -- the place where our mind seem to go when meditating. Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali both accessed this mode by lying in chair, holding something like a metal ball, falling asleep, and then having the balls wake them up -- soon after they would jump into work. You can also access this mode when you're "in the zone" exercising or taking a shower.

3. It takes time. Cramming 20 times in a night is not nearly as good as repeating the material 20 times over the course of several days. The "diffused" mode needs time to work. The brain is a muscle; you wouldn't try to get "big" in one day. 

Cramming is essentially building a brick wall very fast -- it'll probably fall apart.

4. To tackle procrastination, the pomodoro technique can help keep. Give yourself a brief 25 min concentration, then IMMEDIATELY reward yourself for 5 minutes. 

5. Working memory can only hold 4 things. It seems like more because of all the combinations you can make with 4 "slots". 

6. Sleep gets rid of poisons in your brain. Yep, just by being awake, toxins build up. Sleeping shrinks your brain cells, allowing fluid to work between the cells and wash the toxins away.
