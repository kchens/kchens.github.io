1. The prefrontal cortex is the last part of the brain to mature. As it is involved in complex analysis and social interactions...don't get too cocky. You could make a very bad mistake.
2. As you become expert in a subject, you may find that, at times, nothing makes sense. Your new knowledge seems to be of no use. This often happens because your brain is restructuring itself in response to new information.
3. It's helpful to often think of yourself in the metaphor or analogy. 
4. Metaphors and analogies help glue a connection to your mind b/c it glues information to neural structures already there.
5. Metaphors, models, and analogies all break down at some point, but are nonetheless important to giving a *physical* understanding to the concept or process you're trying to understand.
### Practice
Practice enhances the neurons' development of the new technique and strengthens the connections between new areas of the brain. 

Set-up the problem, but you don't necessarily need to do the algebra -- you don't learn anything from that.

###Teamwork
By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, they can act as a external diffuse mode that analyzes how you're thinking about a problem.

####On Difficulty Learning Something New (and being creative)
Having a smaller working memory means you can more easily access other parts of your brain (like the sensory cortex). You often have to work harder sometimes just to understand what is going on. But once you get something chunked, you can turn that idea inside out and outside in.

###Tips on Testing
6. When you're stressed, you release cortisol. Luckily, it's not always bad. With sweaty palms, don't say this test has made you scared -- say it's made you excited! Research the interpretation matters.
7. To battle testing anxiety, be sure to practice deep breathing (like meditation) weeks before the test. This will help you manage the stress.
8. To *really*  face your fears, make sure you have a "Plan B". Study hard until the day of the test, then let it go:  "Let's see how many answers I can get right..I can always go to my second career choice."
9. If you've studied properly, your inability to study the day before the test is a natural response -- as if to save energy for the real thing.
10. 

###To truly double check, blink, shift your attention, then double-check your answers using a big-picture perspective ("does this really make sense?")

###To solve new problems
Mathematician Keith Devlin:  He has never figured something out by sitting at a desk. Almost by definition, to solve something new, focused thinking cannot work. Your mind needs to be engaged in something else (thus access the diffuse mode).

###Fighting Procrastination:  Willpower on the write cue
You don't need a lot of will power, you just need it at the right time.
