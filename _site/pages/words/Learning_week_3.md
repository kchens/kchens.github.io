##Procrastination 

1. Write your tasklist the night before, so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and ensure success. If you don't write your tasks, they use up the edges of the four slots of working memory. You can free that working memory up.
2. Mix tasks up with your learning. For example, use cleaning up your desk as a diffuse mode of learning. Let your mind rest, and work physically for a little while.
3. Plan your quitting time just as you plan your beginning time.  Those committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their handwork outperform those on an endless treadmill. 
4. Eat your frogs first in the morning. Work your most disliked tasks in the morning. Just at least one pomodoro.
5. Give yourself lots of small rewards to celebrate triumphs over procrastination. (like after each pomodoro)
6. Watch for procrastination cues. Then combat them. If noise is a procrastination cue, then go to the quiet part of the library.
7. Work hard when you're working, so as to gain trust in this system.

##Memory
8. Use as many sense-driven, neural "hooks". Think about ways to smell, taste, and hear something that needs remembering.
9. Images are best to use because they connect to your right brain's visual spacial centers. 
10. For something to go from short-term to long-term memory. The thing should be memorable and it must be repeated (over several days).
11. Notecards with images on one side are great for *interleaving* your learning. You can use [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/).

12. Create meaningful groups for things you want to remember. 
13. Acronyms are good. To ward off vampires, you might think of Garlic, Roses, Hawthornes, Mustard -- so use an image of a Graham cracker.
13. Memory palace technique is particularly great. The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items - like a grocery list. You might think of a place you know well like your house. With just 1-2 practice walks through the mind, some people are able to remember as many as 95% of a 50 item grocery list. 
14. Research has shown that students who use these tricks become more experts than those who don't. They make people into semi-experts much more quickly. 
15. The memory process itself becomes a exercise in creativity. The more you memorize using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become. The more you practice this memory muscle, the more easy it will be to remember. 
16. Memory tricks allow people to expand their memory with easy access to long-term memory.
