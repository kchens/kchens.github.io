      <p>NoSQL made waves the past decade with supporters pronouncing the end of SQL. While the tech industry usually adopts the newest innovations, for now it looks like SQL will continue to dominate the database business.</p>
      <h4>NoSQL</h4>
      <p>"Not only SQL" posits that data doesn't always have to stored in relational models (meaning big spreadsheet-like tables). You can store them in distributed or non-relational databases. That means the data can be queried as graphs, documents, columns (essentially, nested arrays), and even key-value pairs. Perhaps the biggest reason NoSQL has been gaining steam is the rise of the modern application.</p>
      <h5>Pros</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>1. NoSQL can scale faster horizontally. That is, you can add a cluster of machines to handle the database.</li>
        <li>2. NoSQL can query very complex and specific data. Because there is not relational structure, a (proper) NoSQL can make a very targeted query.</li>
        <li>3. NoSQL is great for hierarchical and large data sets (through key-value pairs).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That said, there are significant cons.</p>
      <h5>Cons</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Mainly, because NoSQL is so new, there's less standardization. So, it'll be harder to find best practices and makes it hard to identify a "good" NoSQL manager.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As most companies and projects, the benefits of NoSQL are probably not of that big a concern. Really, what is needed is something that is reliable and can do "80%"" of the work.</p>
      <h4>SQL</h4>
      <p>That's where good old SQL comes in. Granted, as a relational model, it is a big spreadsheet - but that doesn't mean it lacks significant pros.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. SQL can handle/store complex data efficiently. What's more, you'll know how to query it because you'll be able to quickly identify the column names.</li>
        <li>2. SQL is standardized and has been for decades. Read through a bit of documentation and you're on your way to querying data.</li>
        <li>3. SQL can scale efficiently, even if it is done vertically (by adding more hardware/system resources).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So whether it's due to better structure, better documentation, or longer history, SQL is still the solid choice for database management today.</p>
