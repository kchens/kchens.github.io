  <li class="subtitle">words on "stereotype threat"</li>
    <li class="date">september 13, 2014</a></li>
    <div class="post">
      <p>There have been two broad event where I felt stereotype threat:  In writing and in interviewing.</p>
      <p>Being Asian, reading and writing was never my friend growing up. From kindergarten throughout first grade, all I did was write one sentence stories and summaries of other books -- something akin to "I like Halloween." Throughout middle school, I wasn't even sure what I was writing half the time. Then, on the SATs, I had no clue where to start, even after I had finished all the prep classes.</p>
      <p>At every juncture, I went into writing with the fear that I wasn't going to do stellar anyway. So, I might as a well just try to get a 650 instead of a 700 on the SAT. I might as well just aim for a A- or B+, never the A.</p>
      <p>Likewise, as I've graduated from college and have interviewed at a plethora of jobs, I have noticed that I still undergo similar problems regarding being "Asian".</p>
      <p>In movies, you find that Asians aren't presented as the most articulate. Especially in the U.S., they struggle to deal with their emotions. As a result, the only time they muster their rhetoric skills together is in a moment of frustration or release.</p>
      <p>Suffice it to say, whenever I interviewed for internship positions early-on in my college career, I would struggle to even say, "Hi", and make small talk in any comfortable way. This made me question whether I should even pursue some of the careers that I think I would've enjoyed. Moreover, I questioned whether it was even worth developing interview skills for this and any business job.</p>
      <p>There are ways to overcome the stereotyping voice inside yourself. It's not immediate, but gradual. They're simple, but nonetheless mentally, emotionally, and physically painful -- there's nothing worse than failing over and over again for years.</p>
      <p>I think it all starts with a question of <em>desire</em> (I refrain to use passion b/c it's, so misconstrued). Whether it's an actual desire because you think, say, reading and writing are cool or just a desire to be better, that desire needs to be there. Desire has no boundaries.</p>
      <p>On the eve of my last SAT, I took some time to think "why" I was taking the test. I had no choice, sure, but humans have a natural gift for rationalizing what they do. In this case, I knew I wanted to be better. Just, generally better. And I could only really stretched myself by going to a great college. I had the grades -- so it was clear I was able to push past previous hurdles. What if I took this test without thinking about my limits? There's no reason why I couldn't score higher than 650.</p>
      <p>Likewise, in interviewing, I knew that I could converse with people until 3am at night. Why couldn't I take that same impassioned debater within and make a case for why I should be hired?</p>
      <p>It's easy to write about all these doubts and fears, each of which are a half decade to two decades old. It wasn't overnight, it took years. But, I eventually scored a perfect on the SAT Verbal. And, after talking to a colleague at an old firm, he mentioned that I was the only candidate that the interview panel unequivocally agreed on.</p>
      <p>Likewise, going into DBC, I suppose my biggest stereotypes I have about myself are the opposite now. I'm not "Asian" enough because I didn't studied something technical in college, I haven't studied math in half a decade. I'm not super-logical, I make leaps to judgment (probably because of my study as a historian).</p>
      <p>I realize that I will encounter pain in trying to stretch my brain. But, I am not too worried about being worried. Coding, as most areas of study, will come with time. So, when I encounter moments of stereotype threat. I will be clear to remind myself of all the hurdles I have overcome. Likewise, I'll be sure to remind others of their past abilities that continue to drive their success into the future.</p>
