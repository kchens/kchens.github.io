    <div class="post">
      <p>Classes are daunting. With possibly hundreds of lines of code, it can be tough to wrap your head around them. Luckily, it's not <em>that</em> hard to figure them out.</p>
      <h4>What are classes?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1. You can think of classes as a BIG method. With many other methods inside of it. (Really, they're objects that knows and does things)</li>
          <li>2. Classes also have certain attributes, or properties, or things about them that make them <em>them</em>! You anc usually list these in the initialize method (explained later).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <code>
            class Puppies #a big method...
              def initialize(color, tail_length)
                ...
              end

              def bark #with a "mini" method
                puts "RAWR"
              end
            end
          </code>
        </ul>
        <p>Here, we have can see that this Dog has a mini method that allows dog's to bark. It also holds a collection of different attributes, like the dog's color (red, white, blue) and tail length (short, medium, long).</p>
      <h4>Why use classes?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Sometimes, you want to create more than one dog. Classes are a way of organizing objects with similar attributes and methods, so you don't have to rewrite all the code over again.</li>
        <code>
          dog_1 = Puppies.new("blue", "short")
          dog_2 = Puppies.new("red", "long")
        </code>
        <p>And, there we go. We have two class objects with the same general attributes and bark method. They're just a little different -- color-wise and tail-wise -- but otherwise they're just as loveable.</p>
      </ul>

      <h4>How to use classes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Initialize some attributes</li>
          <code>
            class Puppies
              def initialize(color, tail_length)
                @color = color
                @tail_length = tail_length
              end
            end
          </code>
          <p>By storing the color of the dog (like "blue"), into the @color variable. The dog object now <em>knows</em> something about itself. Initializing helps the dog know things.</p>
        <li>2. Make some instance methods to help the class <em>do</em> things</li>
          <code>
            class Puppies
              ...

              def bark
                puts "RAWR" + " I'm a dog dammit."
              end
            end

            dog_1 = Puppies.new("blue", "short")
            dog_1.bark
            ## <i>"RAWR I'm a dog dammit."</i>
          </code>
        <li>3. Access instance variables with the proper scope.</li>
          <code>
            class Puppies
              ...

              def bark
                puts "RAWR" + " I'm a #{@color} dog dammit."
                @noise = "loud"
              end

              #the following won't work
              def wrong_sleep
                puts "I'm tired of making such " + @noise + " noise."
              end

              #so you have to write
              def correct_sleep
                puts "I'm going to sleep and dream of #{@color}."
              end
            end

            dog_1.bark
            dog_1.correct_sleep
            ## <i>"RAWR I'm a blue dog dammit."</i>
            ## <i>"I'm going to sleep and dream of blue."</i>
          </code>
          <p>Here, bark and correct_sleep properly dispalys the color of the dog, along with the string. However, wrong_sleep doesn't work. Why? Scoping</p>
          <p>Bark and correct_sleep can access the @color blue because the Puppies' initialize class basically sets a default instance variables that any method can access. However, #wrong_sleep can't access the @noise because @noise is only available/alive/exists within the bark method. That said, if you call #bark first -- @noise will equal "loud" -- and you can correctly call #wrong_sleep.</p>
