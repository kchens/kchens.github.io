  <li class="subtitle">words on "conflict resolution"</li>

    <div class="post">
      <p>Family matters are the toughest. Whereas in a normal relationship you have the choice to continue being friends or romantic interests, with family, you get no choice. Whereas you can give a lover an ultimatum to get with it or get out, with family, you can give all the ultimatums you want, but you're stuck with them forever. And they know that. You have no one else to turn to. It's not like you can ask a stranger on the street to be your next Mom. They don't have to change, and so you're stuck.</p>
      <p>Being as broad as possible, most conflicts I think come down to Respect and Time. Does this person respect you and does he respect the time you've given. </p>
      <p>Off the bat, there are usually two things that happen, I attack others or withdraw and hold my anger inward. Usually, it's the former.</p>
      <p>When things don't change, then I'm 100% attacking others.</p>
      <p>While I know it's not healthy, I wonder does the other side respect me enough to handle the matter? Does the other person value my time enough to sacrifice some of their? When event in quesiton happens again and again, I can only assume "no" to both questions.</p>
      <p>So, I proceed to attack others.</p>
      <p>It doesn't make the conflict better. Yelling never does.</p>
      <p>Yet, while people no longer like to show anger, I believe that it's a means to an end. It's necessary sometimes to stand up. While yelling is deplored, it does get the message across. And apparently, in Dale Carnegie, author of "How To Win Friends and Influence People", thought the same way. Sometimes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BIK9ZYE0IINP/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671723650&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful">"there [are] some people with whom it was impossible to get along. You either [need] to divorce such people, "knock them down," or sue them in court."</a></p>
      <p>But of course, even this doesn't work sometimes. And it makes me question, why even waste my time getting angry in the first place?</p>
      <p>If there are people that I can't get along with, then, at least temporarily, they should be some space. Avoid them. Make it known.</p>
      <p>Time changes the situation. Time change perceptions. And in time, perhaps there can be an understanding from which to branch off from.</p>
