    <div class="post">
      <ol>three of my favorite websites right now:
        <li><a href="http://mint.com">1. Mint.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://slickdeals.net">2. Slickdeals</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://washingtonpost.com">3. The Washington Post</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The best user experience of any news site on the web right now has to be 3. The Washington Post. Whereas other news sites are concerned with users staying on the page -- by clicking on different articles -- WP doesn't do that. When reading an article, it only shows one sidebar of five other articles you might be interested in. No top banner of articles to distract you from the title or beginning of an article -- something which NYTimes and WSJ do.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, I don't actually read the WP. I just went onto their website the other day and fell in love with all the white space the site designers provided. It's literally breathing room for my mind to think while reading.</p>
      <p>In a few words, the WP is streamlined, simple, yet inviting.</p>
      <p>Comparing WP to the other two sites I mentioned is no contest. Mint.com is cluttered with information as well as Slickdeals. However, while the user experience may not be the best in terms of simplicity, both applicaitons do their best given the type of work they do</p>
      <p>For a site that aggregates the hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars of a person's networth, Mint.com does a fantastic job as getting the user directly to the information they need -- be an old transaction from years ago or a new credit card offer they're eligble for. Given the vast amounts of personalized data, I can and do spend hours on the site. It's practical, informative, interactive, and less-hassle.</p>
      <p>I have similar feelings for website #2 Slickdeals. The one thing I would add though is that the website does a great job on the visual dashboard for deals.</p>
      <p>Most days, I won't know what I'm looking for. Moreover, there are tens of items that are on the front-page each day, so reading the text descriptions is completely useless. Slickdeals highlights which deals I should really pay attention to with pictures, a fire symbol for "hot" deals, and the number of "thumbs up" (recs) a deal has received. That way, I can always be sure that I am getting the best, if not a great, deal.</p>
