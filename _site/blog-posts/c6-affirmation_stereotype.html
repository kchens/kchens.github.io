      <p>Values, morals is something I think about daily. Because without the proper moral grounding, improper thoughts go unchecked. Those thoughts can lead to certain actions -- which, if they become unchecked, turn into habits. So, what are the <strong>right</strong> values to have?</p>
      <h4>A List</h4>
        <p>In no particular order, here are a few values I value. I've also listed a 1-5 rating on "how well I live up to the values" (5 is the highest):
        <ul>
          <li>Control:     4</li>
          <li>Ambition:    5</li>
          <li>Power:       3</li>
          <li>Challenge:   3</li>
          <li>Openness:    5</li>
          <li>Money:       3</li>
          <li>Mentorship:  1</li>
          <li>Justice:     3</li>
          <li>Honesty:     4</li>
          <li>Economic Security:  4</li>
          <li>Courage:     4</li>
          <li>Creativity:  3</li>
          <li>Patience:    4</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For some of these values, I have a concrete reason why I have the attached rating. For others, I do not. In any case, this is just a snapshot for me in time.</p>
      <h4>Why Control?</h4>
        <p>While all of the values are inter-related, I think control is the most important one to me. By recognizing when and where I have control, I can dictate how <em>I</em> get to live -- what I let in and what I don't let in into my life. Control means I can do what I want (within limits) without the judgment of something external. Control means freedom to me. Control also means I can choose to give up that freedom to gain in other areas I value (For example, I am eager to take job so I can gain opportunities for mentorship -- even though I'll have to submit to my boss's daily demands). Economic security and money are close, but ultimately the reason why I value the former two is because it can lead to more control in my life.</p>
      <h4>"What should I do for my job?"</h4>
        <p>My friend recently asked me what he should look for in his next job. I told him to do something he wants to make a career out of. And, to find that out, I recommended that he learn about as many possible careers as possible.</p>
        <p>This is seemingly simple advice, but it takes lots of patience. The reality is that a career takes a lifetime to create. I recognize that I probably won't be able to do exactly what I want (start a company) until many years down the road -- there are so many skills I need to learn before I do. So, the next best option is to put myself in a position where I can learn relevant skills. That's why I want a job at a fast-growing start-up with smart mentors.</p>
      <h4>How to defeat self-defeating thoughts.</h4>
        <p>When I start to think that I'm just a caricature of another stereotype (like say, just another Silicon Valley kid learning programming to build a picture app), thinking about these values and how I embody them does help. Thinking about these values shows to me, how I am of, well, value. That while I may not be amazing at programming now, there are other things I'm good at. What's more, my effort to tackle programming aligns with my values perfectly.</p>
        <p>Practically-speaking, the best exercise I can think of to rid one of self-defeating thoughts is to listen to stories about other greats. Be it in politics or programming, listening to how people got started in their domain is always fascinating -- and filled with tales of failures. My favorite to think of is Ira Glass, who admittedly said that, even into his eigth year at This American Life, he was writing just "shitty" stories.</p>
