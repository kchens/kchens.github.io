      <p>To program is to use a computer's resources. And to program efficiently run program, one must understand how the computer "remembers" and executes those programs. Here's quick run through of how computer memory is akin to your human one.</p>
      <p>There are three tiers of memory you have to keep in mind (1) the Hard Drive (2) Random Access Memory (RAM) and (3) Cache. They each have their separate and important function. And by understanding how the CPU accesses the information, we can get a sense of each memory's relative importance.</p>
      <p>Now, think about the last time you took a really hard test. Let's say you're taking an graduate-level chemistry course, and the first question is a doozy. Luckily, it's an open note test. And so, you're scouring your notes to find the right formula needed to solve test problem. It takes you a while, you may need to fuddle around with several papers, but you find it! Well, your notes are essentially the same thing as a computer hard drive. The computer may take some time to find the right information and execute an action, but the information is <em>there</em>.</p>
      <p>Going onto the second question in the test, the professor gives you a breather. The questions slightly difficult, but it was covered in the first lecture and repeated throughout the whole semester. It may take you a moment, but otherwise the information you need to solve the problem is readily available in your mind. So, you write down the relevant formula, and proceed to solve the problem quickly. That's essentially the equivalent of a computer's RAM. Generally, RAM is where the computer stores programs, applications, and data that needs to be readily accessible.</p>
      <p>Let's take a pause from the analogy for a second and delve deeper into the differences between the hard drive and RAM. The reason the hard drive takes so long is that the CPU has to <em>sequentially</em> run through the data to find it (just like how you might start from the beginning your notes to find what you're looking for). On the other hand, the RAM is much faster because the CPU can access that information on any point.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you need a boost in your memory though. There's only ten minutes left until the end of the test, and you're asking and pleading with your brain to work faster. While in real life you may look to your coffee or red bull as a savior to deliver the sudden insights needed to ace the exam, the CPU has the Cache for the same purpose. Whenever the RAM can't keep up, the little bit of Cache can feed information to the CPU fast. This is especially helpful whenever the RAM "backs up" (the CPU runs faster than RAM).</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p>That's it for now. In the next piece, I'll tackle why the computer memory matters so much to computer programming.</p>
