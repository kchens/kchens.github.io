      <p id="importance">   Pairing is important to DBC because it helps you learn to code better, learn to work with others, and prepares you for real-world jobs in web development. Pair programming enables boots to practice what they learn in Engineering Empathy. Furthermore, collaboration helps with spontaneous learning and coming up with creative solutions to problems. </p>

        <h2 class="titles">How today's pairing went...</h2>
        <p id="reflection">Today's pairing went very well, despite some technical difficulties and it being our first guided pairing session. While it was a little nerve-racking pairing in-front of the guide, Kevin and Mike both feel the communication and chemistry was great. It helped that, from the start, we were open about our ideas on how pairing should play out. By doing so, Kevin and Mike were able to work flexibly and produce this "sweet" web page.</p>
