###A Parable on Learning
When people study, they're like dogs. They see what is only in front of them. They may be able to bark louder and run faster after its prey, and -- with enough training -- they'll reach that goal. However, it's not enough to work hard. Time is finite and with today's fast-changing world, our practical knowledge soon becomes obsolete. So, as a dog, you may have grasp something new -- but you're still behind; there's always something new to chase. What's a dog to do then?

The best option is to become a fox.

Unlike the dog, the fox is cunning. The fox works *smarter*. Instead of simply chasing the prey ahead of him, the fox knows the bigger picture. After reaching his current goal, there will still be subsequent prey (new goals to chase after). 

From there, the fox deduces that he'll never stop running. Instead, the fox chooses to pause; he strategizes. And instead of chasing his goal along the same path as the dog, he sees a new path. At first, the path seems longer and more difficult, but really it's a shortcut. While the fox may not catch its current prey before the dog, the fox has built up his ability to strategy for catching prey. He can use these mental shortcuts in the future, so the fox need not howl or run as fast. 

And so, the fox can enjoy his prey, while the dogs continue to run.

###A Reflection on Learning How To Learn

Whenever students approach learning, they are like dogs. Some master -- often times a school administrator -- tells them to jump through a hoop. So, students train to jump through hoops. But they never learn beyond this one technique.

However, if you -- the student -- want to have a creative and intelligent mind  like that of Leonardo Da Vinci or Einstein, you can't just be told what to do. Amongst other things, you have to realize the underlying lesson:  What transferrable skills can you learn about jumping through a hoop? 

At it's very basis, I think the core skill is a meta-skill:  learning how to learn. 

Now, how do you do that effectively? Assuming that you have the [mindset](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=techs024-20&linkId=MN63E53VQIBBVQLE) figured out. Here are the three broad ways (shortcuts, really) to help you become a cunning and overachieving fox.

###1.  Feed Your Brain

I've always found it interesting as a high schooler or college student how summer was just playtime. For two to three months, no one expected you to be studying. Yet, when you came back to school the next year, you seemed to remember everything you learn the prior year -- and in many ways you were able to apply what you learned in a deeper and more meaningful way. 

Take programming. This past summer, some events forced me to take a break from programming everyday or even every week. Yet, when I came back to my study, somehow I knew (intuitively) how to program. Neuroscientifically, there's a reason for this (which we'll get to). 

However, before I could have even taken a break, I still needed to *focus* to learn programming.

#####Chunk Information
Knowing what I know now, I would've started chunking and contextualizing information far more. Your brain needs something to chew on, but your brain can't just chew on the raw ingredients. You have to make the dish -- in this case, a chunk.

Neuroscientifically, a chunk is a set of neurons bound together through use and meaning. More intuitively, a chunk is a set of information that just kind of goes together -- like a good dish! 

To create this dish, you need to focus hard. You need to walk through the logic and make the connections between the new information. You have to keep working at it until you understand the *fundamental* idea of what you're studying.

It's going to be painful. I mean, you are literally working your brain out. But, if you can just focus on the *process* and not the end goal, you'll find that you enjoy it, like a good run or soccer game. 

Perhaps the best way to make yourself focus on the task at hand is the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/21/the-science-of-procrastination/). Just tell yourself you're going to do this mini-25-minute work out. Make it a challenge. Can you really do this for 25-minutes?

#####Contextualize 
The first time you chunk some new information, the idea will take up one of the only four slots of your working memory. It's going to be hard to juggle what you're trying to understand.

If, before and during your deep dives into a puzzling idea, you try to understand how that puzzle fits into the bigger picture, chances are you'll eventually grasp the basic idea.

#####Recall
To move this new chunk from short-term to long-term memory, you'll want to quiz yourself. Can you remember what you studied?

Studies show that, while simple, simply recalling the information (facts, processes, ideas, etc.) actually strengthens those chunking neurons and your understanding of that material.

###2.  Relax Into Your Knowledge
Chunking is important to comprehension. But I think you have to *let go* of trying so hard in order to become a master. I suppose it's kind of like, you have to focus and practice enough to the point that you just kind of "know". Taking a vacation from what you're studying -- like I did with programming -- may yield greater results.

If you work hard, here's how you play hard (so you can work better).

#####Diffuse Mode
Story goes that [Archimedes discovered the mathematical equation for volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29) while taking a bath. Just as Archimedes *let go* of his focus on the problem (taking a step back from his using his prefrontal cortext), the back of his mind kept working on the problem. Academics call this "background" processing the Diffuse mode.

The Diffuse mode is when the brain starts making connections between neurons outside of those normally used for chunking. In this state, the brain can come up with new, creative, and "big picture" ways to thinking about a problem.

So when you think you're just watching T.V., playing sports, or chatting with friends, the reality is that your brain is still working on problems in the background. That's why it's so important to set a quitting time. To give yourself some time to relax after a hard days work. You're still working you just don't know it yet.

#####Sleep
Sleep is perhaps the best diffuse mode. It's 8 hours of the day when you actively shut down the conscious "you". Yet, your brain is still rehearsing what you've chunked -- strengthening the neural connections.

You can even enlist your sleeping self to help you learn better. If you study before you sleep, you're more likely to dream about what you're studying. Most interestingly, if you *ask yourself to dream* about the material, you are more likely to. This way you can really consolidate your learning.

The most important reason is that you are **poisoning yourself if you don't sleep**. Just being awake creates poisonous chemicals in your brain. Sleeping allows your brain cells to shrink -- allowing brain fluid to flow through and clear out the poisons.

If you don't get enough sleep, these poisons persist and muddle the clarity of your thoughts.

###Closing
While this is not an exhaustive list of techniques to improve your ability to learn, it is a starting point. Most likely, you're familiar with the importance of focus and hard work. But to evolve beyond a dog, you'll need use your focused mind to the best of its ability. So, chunk your information, contextualize it, and recall, recall, recall to consolidate what you've learned.

But just as important. Save time for relaxation; don't work all the time. Watching a movie or getting a good night's sleep is, in many ways, also an important workout for your brain. Become a slightly-more lazy but super cunning fox.

###3.  Make Knowledge Permanent 

#####Multiple Mediums
Different approaches, concepts in one session.

#####Multiple Environments
Try recalling your knowledge in different environments. You pick up subtle cues from your environment. If you study in two, three or more places, you can make your knowledge more available to you.
