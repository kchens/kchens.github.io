#iCare:  A Health App That Patients Want To Use

###The Problem
At the Phillips HealthSuite Hackathon, we were presented with developing a caregiver management tool for a 69-year-old woman, who just had her hip replaced.

There were a couple of roadblocks that we anticipated and saw from other healthcare apps on the market:
Patients don't want to use the app -- too focused on making the patient feel "sick".
2.	Apps provide lots of data, but no actionable information for health professionals

###Our Idea

We first and foremost created an app that patients *want* to use. iCare gives them a reason to use an app:  **We created a family, social network where the person can communicate with their family members.** In turn, the app lets those family members make doctor notes alongside relevant texts and pictures.

Then, we filter this qualitative data and combine them with quantitative signals. That way doctors aren't overloaded with information.

###What I Worked On
1.	Firebase Chat - Implemented Firebase and the resulting chat view.
2.	[Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) - Super easy and fun open-source Timeline. 
3.	HTML/CSS/jQuery Mobile - Suffice it to say. Much of this hackathon was  spent making things look nice. I learned that jQuery mobile is a complete pain.
