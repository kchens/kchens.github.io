1. In learning math & science, it helps to use a "roadmap". That is, going through a worked out example and trying to figure out "why" the solution works. 
2. However, it's important to try and recall this information -- as with any information (like when reading). By recalling information/concepts/why, you're doing your brain more help than by simply looking at it over again (like looking straight at the solution or concept mapping or re-reading a passage).
3. It is important to realize that understanding how a problem is solved does not create a chunk you can call upon later. This is not expertise. Only by closing the book and DOING it yourself can create a chunk. 
4. Chunking is a bottom-up learning process. Top-down learning is "big picture" learning.
5. Context is where bottom-up and the top-down learning meet.
6. So, a rapid, 2-minute picture walk-through the big picture of a book chapter can help bring about context. 

7. Recalling material *outside* your *usual* place of study can strengthen your grasp of the material. When you study, you take subtle cues from the environment around you. But, when you are taking tests, you take a test in a different environment. By studying in different places, you and your recall of the material becomes *independent* of any one place. 

8. Acetecoylin is associated with focused learning and attention.
9. Serotonin is associated with social life and risk-taking behavior. Prisoners have low levels of serotonin. 

8. The best way to learn new chunks is to *interweave* between another chunk. When you're learning a new technique in Chemistry, be sure to flip back and forth between a recent technique you learned. interleaving can seem to make your learning more difficult, but, *in reality*, it helps you learn more deeply. OR, deliberately figure out why some problems ask for one problem and not another. 
9. Interleaving helps build flexibility and creativity. Interleaving within a discipline helps deepen your expertise. Interleaving between several subjects can help you make interesting new connections between different fields.
