###Interviewing
####Bad Questions
*	What they would do / like / want in a hypothetical scenario
*	How often they do things each week 
*	How much they like things on an absolute scale (*On a scale of 1 to 10*)
*	Binary Questions (that elicit a "Yes" or "No" answer)

####Good Questions
1. Be as open-ended as possible
2. Ask people to compare the product to something else instead of evaluating on an absolute scale

###Additional Needfinding Strategies
####Diary Studies
Give people a diary and tell them to complete an entry at a specific time or interval. You can also give them a structured entry format to help them complete the entry efficiently. 

You can use journals, cameras, voice, video, etc. -- tailor the recording to the context. So, if you want to capture a finding when using a mobile phone, attach a post-it note so they can go ahead and complete an entry (Often times, an audio recorder is most appropriate). 

Diaries scale better than direct observation studies. And, the easier you make it to record, the better the results. Finally, if you provide some training, practice, and reminding, you'll see better results.

####Experience Sampling
Experience sampling is a research method that asks participants to stop and make notes of their experience in real time. Nowadays, it's easy to do this with the mobile phone.

####Lead Users vs Extreme Users
Lead users are people who face a need that *will become* a general need in the market. As such, they're likely to benefit greatly by obtaining a solution to their needs (and will likely help you out with some your design goals).

Extreme Users are those who aren't necessarily mainstream. Whether they have an interesting profession or just uses email less or more than the average person, they each have valuable design *ideas and insights that might translate more broadly.*

Note:  Keep in mind who you're designing for.

####Personas
After collecting all the data, create a persona.

* Include demographics, but also capture a person's motivations, beliefs, intentions, behaviors, and goals

Draw a picture of your persona or stock photo. Give him a name, a story to tell. *It helps you build empathy.* By doing so, you can understand their state of mind, emotion, philosophy, and perspective. *Empathy leads to insights which leads to design opportunities.*

###Designing a Design Plan: Activity Analysis
####1. Steps:  Recreate them
Write down and map out a user's steps to, say, starting a car. 

*Unlock the car door --> take a seat behind the wheel --> insert key --> turn key --> start engine* 

####2. Artifacts:  Note them
Artifacts are the items.

* *key*
* *car*:  door-lock, ignition switch.	

####3. Goals
Here, your perspective as a designer will come into play.

*Is the goal to turn on the car? Pick up bread? Make a meal?
*
####4. Pain Points
Pain points depend on the goals.

* *Turning on the car: Once the key is in, why does it need to be turned? Why can't you just drive off*
* *To get bread: Why take the car? Why not call for delivery? Ride a bike?*

####All these steps *can* be adapted
You can inclue **joy points** instead of pain points. More formality or less. Individual settings vs. group settings.
