#3 Takeaways From My First Hackathon

This weekend, I attended the Philips HealthSuite Hackathon. While I was impressed with the food and venue, I have to say this may be my first and last Hackathon for a long while.

###1. Business Outweighs The Technical Importance
First and foremost, I was put off by the judging and the quality of the app. 

More than half of the winners seemed to only have PowerPoint slides. Even more upsetting is that one team (I knew of them because they were all Dev Bootcampers), implemented Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with 4 apps. But, they were displaced for 4th place by a group that made a SquareSpace site with two OAuths. 

Ultimately, it seemed like the winners of this hackathon (and I hear most hackathons) are judged by mostly business people. While not a terrible idea, I would've hoped there was more of a focus on the technical -- not just the "idea".

###2. Learning isn't a priority
Unless your team is 100% focused on trying something new, and not on winning, then you might have had a different experience. But chances are someone on your team *will* want to try and win. Who doesn't? The prizes are a fun reward.

That said, if you're going to a Hackathon hoping that you're going to try out this cool technology and really make a working prototype -- that's probably not the case - especially if none of your team members know that technology either.

###3. Networking...actually isn't that bad.
When all was said and done, I have to say that it was a nice bonding experience. I saw some folks I hadn't seen in a while and got to partner with some old partners.
