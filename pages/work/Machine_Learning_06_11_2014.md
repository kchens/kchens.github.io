#Coursera: Introduction to Machine Learning

Zipping through topics from gradient descent to neural networks, the course reinvigorated my interest in math.

I took this course because I wanted a glimpse beyond web development. I wanted to understand what exactly "machine learning" was beyond the buzzword it has become. 

Suffice it to say, I'm pleased. I feel like I'm on the cusp of understanding enough machine learning to make my programs more powerful. 

That said, I think I'll take this course again -- to audit and go through the programming exercises once more. The course did cover a lot of ground. Before I do, I'll need to find a project to make the effort worthwhile.

Stay tuned:  I'll soon update this page with notes and other thoughts I had on this Coursera course.
