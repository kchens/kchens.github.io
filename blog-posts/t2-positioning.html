      <p>Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning may sound like nonsense to you. As words, you're probably knowledgeable about the meaning, but, when it comes to programming CSS, they all mean the same thing to you:  nonsense. Well, if you're a beginner, no fear! I'm here to illuminate the difference.</p>

      <h4>magical scrapbook</h4>
      <p>To talk about each, we first have to lay some ground rules. First, we have to talk about static positioning - the default positioning value of anything you see on a webpage. Second, we need an analogy; imagine a scrapbook!</p>
      <p>Now, this is a magical scrapbook. And, one of the magical rules it has is that you must place each and every picture in the top left corner -- no "if"s, "and"s, or "but"s.</p>

      <h4>static positioning</h4>
      <p>In placing your first picture into the scrapbook that means you'll have to abide by the scrapbook's "default" rules. So, you put that picture of the cake you baked in the top left. This default positioning has another name:  <b>static positioning</b>. (To say another way, there is no positioning)</p>

      <h4>relative positioning</h4>
      <p>What if you would like to move forgo the magical scrapbooks crummy rules? Well, you can call upon the powers of <b>relative positioning</b>. By doing so in the stylesheet, you can then move your picture anywhere you want to! You just need to specify how far the picture is from the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the scrapbook page.</p>
      <p>Here we can see that "One" follows the static position (upper-left), while "Two" is <i>relative</i> to where it should be (it's indented from the top and left):</p>
      <code>mom { top: 20px; left: 20px;}</code>

      <img id="fixed_relative" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4922/=relative-positioning.png">

      <h4>fixed positioning</h4>
      <p>Now, as often happens with scrapbooks, you run out of space. But instead of going to the next page, this is a magical scrapbook. Instead of flipping left-to-right, this scrapbook is a vertical scroll -- like a Chinese painting or pirate's treasure map.</p>
      <p>You can use this to your benefit. As you care a lot about your mom (we all do), you'll want to keep your mom's picture even with your eyes even as you unscroll. <b>Fixed positioning</b> does this. But, where to keep your mom's picture? Closer to the top so she's know's she's #1? Or at the bottom because she's always got your "back"? To the left? Right? Well, you can specify that too with proper margin and padding.</p>

      <p>While not a perfect picture, imagine that the following red box is your mom's picture:</p>
      <img class="fixed_pos" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4924/=fixed-1.png?size=thumb">
      <img class="fixed_pos" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4925/=fixed-2.png?size=thumb">
      <p>As you scroll downward, the red box stays at the exact place where you placed it.</p>

      <h4>absolute positioning</h4>
      <p>Sometimes, you find scary pictures in this magical scrapbook, and you'd like to cover them up. Not a problem! <b>Absolute positioning</b> makes it easier to cover anything scary with your mom's picture. All you have to do is make sure that scary picture has the <i>position</i> attribute. Then, right next to that CSS attribute, specify your mom's absolute positioning:</p>

      <code>one_scaryimage { position: relative }</code>
      <code>two_mom { position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 20px}</code>

      <img id="abs_pos" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4923/=absolute-positioning.png">

      <p>With those two lines of code -- specifying the distance from the top and left -- we can cover the scary image with your mother's picture.</p>
