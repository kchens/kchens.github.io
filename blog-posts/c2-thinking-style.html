  <li class="subtitle">words on "thinking styles:  abstract random"</li>

    <div class="post">
      <p>According to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal think</a> quiz, my thinking style is "abstract random". Besides being well-represented in the U.S. with 30% of the population having a similar style, what else does this mean?
      </p>
      <p>Apparently, my people like (1) to  experiment to find answers (2) work in a noncompetitive atmosphere, yet also likes competition (3) have personalized learning where personal attention and emotional support are given (4) activities that require them to use their intuition.</p>
      <p>This makes sense to me. In college, I was more of a liberal arts person -- engaged in one-on-one, late-night conversations regarding philosophy. I excelled at papers once I committed to them -- turning over the pages of every last footnote to make the "perfect" paper.</p>
      <p>Taking the inverse, all these supposed "likes" also make sense. While I was strong in math in high school, once the structure of the classroom of the room was removed, I flailed. And while, I wanted to work with people to further my understanding of a topic, I couldn't help but feel that I was behind others in those more technical topics. It wasn't very good for my confidence.</p>
      <p>So, it's no surprise that some things I -- an abstract random person -- struggle with are (1) routines (2) redoing anything once it's finished (3) working alone (4) expecting less emotional response from others.</p>
      <p>In Phase 0 so far, I have struggled with these routines, working alone on difficult problems, and shutting up during pairing.</p>
      <p>In pairing, I like to play-it-by-ear. As an abstract random person, I learn best by trial-and-error, so I have a hard time always explaining myself first -- then coding. Sometimes, I like to have the code speak for itself. When combined with my dislike of routine, I can come off as disrespectful towards a pair. In reality, it's me trying to figure out a problem. To solve the problem, I think I can be more upfront about my time limits as my drive to solve the problem is exacerbated by needing to get things done on time. To work better at this in the future, I will try to schedule my pairing sessions earlier in the week; secondly, I can let my pair know that I am working through trial-and-error so that I can better layout a concept. To me, making sure that we are both solid on the concepts is the most important thing.</p>
      <p>Regarding personal work, it's true that I rarely go back to my work to check it (after I've double-checked and declared myself finished!) and I despise routine. To help guard against that, I've begun to play around and taking more responsibility for my education. If need be, I'll read non-required portions of books/websites. I'll deep dive into StackOverflow to broaden my knowledge. That said, I like that parts of the curriculum, like the solo challenge, allow me to be as creative as I like. That there seems to be no hard grading criteria there. So, a second thing I will try to do more is to rush or try out the solo challenge first -- let myself experiment -- before finishing other parts of the curriclum for the week.</p>
