      <p>Pairing has always scared me...probably because I paired with people way above my skill level (It never feels good to feel like an idiot). However, pairing with fellow Dev Bootcamp mates is a pleasure. When working with someone at your skill level.</p>
      <h5>My first pairing building this <a href="http://kchens.github.io/gps/first/gps1.1.html">website</a>.</h5>
        <p>Working with Mike Steichen was nerve-racking. As my first pair with someone at my level, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to run-my-mouth or remain quiet and inquisitive. Or both. It didn't help that we had a Dev Bootcamp guide evaluating us.</p>
        <p>This was a particularly bad week to pair as well -- I had almost but forgotten my html knowledge. We stumbled on questions regarding HTML5 formatting. And, we took an hour to figure out how to add padding and margins.</p>
        <p>Luckily, we quickly settled into a workable and fun relationship.</p>
        <p>By first taking 5 minutes to explain our philosophies on pairing (driving vs. navigation), we were able to fix all the awkward silences that had troubled my previous pairing sessions. There was no indecision on whether something should be said or not.</p>
      <h5>The biggest difference:  Switching roles</h5>
        <p>Perhaps, the confidence booster in Dev Bootcamp pairing is that we can switch roles. Mike and I decided from the get-go to switch every 30 minutes -- which surprising turned out to be the right amount of time. According to the Pomodoro technique, you should give yourself about half an hour of complete focus, then a break. Likewise, switching to navigator every 30 minutes helps me take a bigger picture on the problem every now and then.</p>
      <h5>Interesting thoughts</h5>
        <p>What's interesting writing this post is that I've come to realize how much <b>programming is a team sport</b>. The two most important things to a productive and successful pairing session (as in, you solve the programming problem efficiently and concisely), is that the pairs communicate. You over communicate. You say when you're getting tired and need to switch. You say your thoughts aloud on what might or might not work. You listen to subtle cues to keep quiet and let your pair figure things out. You communicate on what it means to pair. Just those 5 minutes in the beginning are a huge time saver.</p>
