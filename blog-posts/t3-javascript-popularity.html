  <li class="subtitle">words on "why javascript is popular"</li>

      <p>There's a debate raging ast to whether to use JavaScript as a backend language, like with Node.js. However, before jumping into that debate, let's take a step back and remember why JS is so popular to begin with.
      </p>
      <h5>the rise.</h5>
        <p>JavaScript came about during the mid-90s at Netscape. As an interpreted language (a language that doesn't need a compiler), JS was aimed at non-professional programmers. Moreover, since it was developed in-house at THE browser of the time, many of the features were well-aimed at the web.</p>
        <p>Once it was submitted for standardization and consideration as an industry standard in 1996, ECMA International soon accepted it (1997) and the first verison was published that year. As a result, JavaScript became more open and the standardization had continued through open-sourced contributions.
        </p>
        <p>So, it's easy to see that the "web" + "standardization" has helped JavaScript rise as the web has grown itself.</p>
      <h5>the good.</h5>
        <p>
          1) JS can run in the browser, thus providing dynamic, user interactions with the DOM.
          2) Most browsers and most smartphones can run JavaScript.
          3) It's a flexible language that you can do almost anything with.
        </p>
      <h5>the bad.</h5>
          1) If you were to replace JS with any other language, <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/05/06/why-javascript-is-doomed/">"you don't really miss anything."</a>
          2) The new frameworks for JS are great, but that doesn't solve JS glaring problems like <a href="https://wiki.theory.org/YourLanguageSucks#JavaScript_sucks_because">type system.</a>
          3) Because different browser/smartphones/clients have different JS-rendering engines, JS can load differently; so, the interface and functionality may seem a little funky at times.
