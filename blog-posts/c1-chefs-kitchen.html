      <p>I'm more excited to attend Dev Bootcamp after watching Shereef's fireside talk. I'm ecstatic to be surrounded by people who are committed to programming for 12+ hours a day.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of this year, I began to self-teach myself programming. I locked myself up in my room for pretty much the whole day, for six days a week. However, it was so easy to procrastinate and get discouraged working by myself. With the Dev Bootcamp community, it's intensity, and it's emphasis on kindness (amongst other traits), I hope work beside those who will elevate me.</p>
      <p>My expectations changed after watching the video in regards that I might be "too" advanced. As I've worked through the Hartl Tutorial several times now -- and have even built a few sites based on tutorials, I feel like I have a descent grasp on Rails. However, I do see the experience as one where I'm internalizing coding and how to become better at the EQ side of programming. I haven't paired much before, so doing so will help me further these goals. In this regard, I'll always be a student; everyone will be my teacher. </p>
